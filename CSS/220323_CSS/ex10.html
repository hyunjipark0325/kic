          <div>The double colon replaced the single-colon notation for pseudo-elements in CSS3. This was an attempt from W3C to distinguish between pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements. The single-colon syntax was used for both pseudo-classes and pseudo-elements in CSS2 and CSS1. For backward compatibility, the single-colon syntax is acceptable for CSS2 and CSS1 pseudo-elements.</div>
